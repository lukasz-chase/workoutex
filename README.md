Welcome to workoutex, a simple app I created to learn react native, tailwind and firebase:
You can signup/signin

After singing in you can look through exercises, sort them by muscle or equipment and you can also search by name

And you can press each exercise to get details about it

On your profile page it displays your email and lets you sign out
